## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Formula 1 racing history, spanning from the inaugural season in 1950 to 2025. This project leverages **Python** to uncover historical patterns, identify legendary drivers, and visualize the rise and fall of constructor teams over decades.

The goal is to transform raw racing statistics into actionable insights and compelling visual stories.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Python:** The core programming language used for analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and filtering (e.g., extracting specific seasons or teams).
* **Matplotlib:** For creating data visualizations (Bar charts for comparisons, Line plots for time-series).
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The interactive environment used for coding and documentation.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1. 👑 The King of Monaco
Who dominates the most difficult circuit in the world?
> **Insight:** Data analysis reveals that **Ayrton Senna** holds the all-time record for wins at the *Circuit de Monaco*, outperforming modern legends.
